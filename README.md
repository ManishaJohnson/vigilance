Crime Hotspot Mapping Website

## Introduction
It is frequently observed that crimes do not happen at random; rather, time and place have an impact on criminal behavior and the victimization of people. Finding hotspots/zones where a specific crime is more common is therefore crucial to resolving crime concerns. Hotspot mapping is a common analytical methodology that aids in identifying locations where a greater concentration of an activity takes place and this hotspot mapping serves as a key component of crime prediction.
### 1.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this system is to identify high-crime locations and highlight the places that demand additional police and law enforcement presence. In order to draw attention to the sensitivity of the crime type and raise public awareness, a different colored zonal mapping is also generated. Some of the popular criminal categories for classification in the Indian Penal Code include the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, the Gambling Act, the Arms Act, the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, the Mineral and Mining Act, and the Goonda Act.
### 1.1.2 Intended Use
Using maps to identify crime hotspots can help people become more familiar with the different parts of a city or even shed light on why crime occurs there.  Maps can be used by law enforcement to increase surveillance in particularly vulnerable areas. Data integration capabilities of the system with CCTV cameras and other police apps like "Lakshya Public eye." This allows police to input CCTNS FIR data, which then automatically aligns with the interface and displays a zonal depiction of crime on maps of cities according to the area.
1.1.3 Scope of Project
For use in the Indian sub-continent region, this software system will be a hotspot mapping for crime detection. The system will be built to provide tools to help detect crime hotspots around the law enforcement officials' intended jurisdiction, maximizing their productivity. 
In order to improve the safety aspects of civilian lives, this system is intended to make the public and police more aware of the criminal activity around their area of interest. Dashboards are offered for more in-depth application research, and there will be pre-formatted error messages for smooth accessibility and understanding within the application. The system will also include a  database with a list of users and information about their permissions.


## Overall Description
### 1.2.1 User Needs
The following are the users applicable for the system
1.	Police Admins are authorized to provide inputs for the database regarding crime rates to increase higher security of valid data
2.	Police Officers need to quickly identify high probable crime spots in order to decrease the crime rate in their selected police jurisdiction area
3.	General public needs to quickly observe the safety within a specific area in order to avoid highly probable crime spots when possible
### 1.2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
1.	The police department has all the available hardware required to support the intended user load
2.	The input data provided is as close to the original and can be easily integrated with any existing input data available within the Police database after general tests
